
It’s time to continue building our project.

1. **Commit your current work** locally before starting.
2. **Review** Issue #1 (`context`) on GitHub and **the next open issue (`epic`)**
3. **Create a new branch** named after the epic (short, lowercase, hyphenated — e.g., `epic/feature-auth`).
4. **Complete the entire issue/epic**, following its acceptance criteria and any notes in the context issue.
5. When complete:
  - Verify all validation commands succeed (`pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`).
  - Commit and push changes, open a pull request if required, and **close the issue**.
  - Include in the issue close comment:
    - **Summary:** a short description of what was implemented.
    - **Testing instructions:** clear steps for me to verify (include all relevant URLs or credentials).
    - **Notes:** anything important learned or deferred.

6. **Report back here** with:
  - A short summary of what you completed.
  - Any newly available URLs or commands I should test.

⚠️ **Important:**
- Only complete **one epic per run** before returning here for confirmation.
- Follow the design standards in `CLAUDE.md` and `DESIGN.md` at all times.
- Always prioritize existing shadcn/react components, coding patterns, and libraries.
