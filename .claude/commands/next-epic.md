3. **Review** all closed `epic` issues to understand what has been completed
4. **Select** the next LOWEST NUMBER open `epic` issue to work on
5. **Determine** how you plan to complete this epic (use ultrathink)
6. **Summarize** (brief single bulleted list) your plan before you start. Await my approval.
7. **Complete the entire issue**, following acceptance criteria and any notes in the context issue.
8. When complete:

9. **Report back here** with:

⚠️ **Important:**
